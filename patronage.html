            <p>Outcalls have a 90 minute&nbsp;minimum.<br /> Flying me to or with you requires a minimum 12 hour booking.<br /> A stipend of 600 dollars for west coast travel and 1000 dollars for east coast travel must also be included in addition to my
                donation.</p>

            <p>Before we meet:<br />
                <br /> Communication will primarily be done through my assistant.</p>

            <p>Screening is non-negotiable. Your full name, work verification and references (if available) will always be needed for new lovers. If you do not have references there are alternative methods for additional screening, simply inquire.</p>

            <p>A non refundable deposit of 20 percent is due prior to our date. Cancellations do happen, and if you know you will need to cancel please let me know as soon as possible. A cancelation fee of 50 percent is required to remain in good standing
                with less than one day&#39;s notice. If canceling less than 24 hours in advance a cancelation fee of 50 percent is necessary to remain in good standing. Full payment is required for all dates canceled with less than 24 hours&nbsp;notice.</p>

            <p>I prefer to get to know someone face to face, so please no lengthy emails prior to our date. I always appreciate a sweet note here and there between dates but keep in mind that I am not always able to answer urgent emails as quickly as I would
                like. The best way to contact me quickly is by subscribing to my OnlyFans, I always respond in a timely manner!</p>

            <p>Please leave the donation in an envelope or your favorite book in plain sight at the beginning of the date. I would hate to spoil the mood by discussing something as dull as financials.</p>

            <p>I am tested weekly for Covid-19 and I ask that you keep yourself safe as well. I always travel wearing a mask and expect my dates to do so.</p>
